To read this file, we need to open the same file that we just added text to using the “r” argument. Then we need to use the “.readlines” method to read each line. We then save these lines to a list and iterate through the list. Each iteration we need to strip part of it and then take the content and add it to a dictionary or list. Or we can print the contents. To save a csv file, first we need to import the CSV module. Then, we need to open the file and use the “w” argument to write in code. We then use the “csv.DictWriter” method and use the correct arguments. Then we use the “writeheader()” method to organize the dictionary. Lastly, we iterate through notes, and write in head writerow from list we iterate through. To read in the csv file, we need to open the csv file, but this time using the “r” argument so that we read the file and to write it. Then we need to use the “DictReader” method on the csv file.

Then, once we have imported the module, we need to open the file we want and use the “w” argument. Then we use the json.dump() method which writes in all the content to the file. To read a JSON file, we need to open the JSON file and then load all the content that is in the file using json.load() method. We can store all of this load content into a list or other variable.\n",

    "When you are coding and you are noticing that part of your code is constantly being repeated, this is a sign that you could need to use a function to simplify your code. Functions in python can be run whenever you call the function, and you can pass data through them in the form of parameters. To create a function, you use the word “def” followed by the name of your function and parenthesis. Then you use a colon and start writing your lines of code indented beneath the line you have just written. Functions can be made for anything, and they are fun to make.\n",
